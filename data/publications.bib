  abstract  = {Transportation Network Companies employ dynamic pricing methods at periods of peak travel to incentivise driver participation and balance supply and demand for rides. Surge pricing multipliers are commonly used and are applied following demand and estimates of customer and driver trip valuations. Combinatorial double auctions have been identified as a suitable alternative, as they can achieve maximum social welfare in the allocation by relying on customers and drivers stating their valuations. A shortcoming of current models, however, is that they fail to account for the effects of trip detours that take place in shared trips and their impact on the accuracy of pricing estimates. To resolve this, we formulate a new shared-ride assignment and pricing algorithm using combinatorial double auctions. We demonstrate that this model is reduced to a maximum weighted independent set model, which is known to be APX-hard. A fast local search heuristic is also presented, which is capable of producing results that lie within 10% of the exact approach for practical implementations. Our proposed algorithm could be used as a fast and reliable assignment and pricing mechanism of ride-sharing requests to vehicles during peak travel times.},

	journal 	= {Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management},
	note 		= {In Press},
	year 		= {2020},
	abstract = {Delays in construction projects are both disruptive and expensive. Thus, potential causes of schedule deviation need to be identified and mitigated. In previous research, delay factors were predominantly identified through surveys administered to stakeholders in construction projects. Such delay factors are typically considered individually and presented at the same level without explicitly examining their sequence of occurrence and interrelationships. In reality, owing to the complex structure of construction projects and long execution time, non-conformance to schedule occurs by a chain of cascading events. An understanding of these linkages is important not only for minimising the delays, but also for revealing the liability of stakeholders. To explicitly illustrate the cause-effect and logical relationship between delay factors and further identify the primary factors which possess the highest significance toward the overall project schedule delay, the fault tree analysis (FTA) method, a widely implemented approach to root cause problems in safety-critical systems, has been systematically and rigorously executed.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are being increasingly implemented in a range of applications. Their low payload capacity and ability to overcome congested road networks enables them to provide fast delivery services for urgent high-value low-volume cargo. This work investigates the economic viability of integrating UAVs into urban hospital supply chains. In doing so, a strategic model that determines the optimal configuration of supporting infrastructure for urgent UAV delivery between hospitals is proposed. The model incorporates a tailored facility location algorithm that selects an optimal number of hubs given a set of candidates and determines the number of UAVs required to fulfil total demand. The objective is to minimize the total cost of implementation, computed as the sum of generalised, battery, vehicle and hub establishment costs. The model is applied to a case study based on the establishment of a UAV delivery network for deliveries between NHS hospitals in London. A baseline scenario is also developed using current NHS vehicles for delivery. Our results demonstrate that UAV-based delivery provide significant reductions in operational costs compared to the baseline. Furthermore, our analysis indicates the location of hubs is more significant to the solution optimality than any increase in range or payload.},

	abstract = {Large-scale evacuations constitute common life-saving exercises that are activated in many disaster response campaigns. Their effectiveness is often inhibited by traffic congestion, disrupted and imperfect coordination mechanisms, and the poor state of the underlying transportation networks. To address this problem, this paper presents a hybrid simulation-optimisation methodology to optimise evacuation response strategies through demand staging and signal phasing. We introduce a pre-planning model that evaluates evacuation policies, using a low-level dynamic traffic assignment model that captures the effects of congestion, queuing and vehicle spillback. Optimal strategies are determined using derivative-free optimisation algorithms, applied to an evacuation problem based on a benchmark dataset. The effects of varying the number of activated paths and the frequency of departure under different network conditions are observed. Our analysis indicates that combined departure time scheduling and signal phasing is a promising method to improve evacuation efficiency when compared to a worst-case benchmark scenario.}

	Year 		= {2020},
	abstract 	= {The ability to obtain accurate estimates of city-wide urban traffic patterns is essential for the development of effective intelligent transportation systems and the efficient operation of smart mobility platforms. This paper focuses on the network-wide traffic speed estimation, using trajectory data generated by a city-wide fleet of ride-sourcing vehicles equipped with GPS-capable smartphones. A cell-based map-matching technique is proposed to link vehicle trajectories with road geometries, and to produce network-wide spatio-temporal speed matrices. Data limitations are addressed using the Schatten p-norm matrix completion algorithm, which can minimize speed estimation errors even with high rates of data unavailability. A case study using data from Chengdu, China, demonstrates that the algorithm performs well even in situations involving continuous data loss over a few hours, and consequently, addresses large-scale network-wide traffic state estimation problems with missing data, while at the same time outperforming other data recovery techniques that were used as benchmarks. Our approach can be used to generate congestion maps that can help monitor and visualize traffic dynamics across the network, and therefore form the basis for new traffic management, proactive congestion identification, and congestion mitigation strategies.},

The model considers the manufacturing, storage, and assembly stages, along with the selection of optimal warehouse locations. Using robust optimisation, the model accounts for common causes of schedule deviations in construction sites, including inclement weather, late deliveries, labour productivity fluctuations and crane malfunctions. A school dormitory construction project is used as a case study, demonstrating that the proposed model outperforms existing techniques in settings with multiple sources of uncertainty.",

	abstract = {Critical infrastructure systems are becoming increasingly interdependent, which can exacerbate the impacts of disruptive events through cascading failures, hindered asset repairs and network congestion. Current resilience assessment methods fall short of fully capturing such interdependency effects as they tend to model asset reliability and network flows separately and often rely on static flow assignment methods. In this paper, we develop an integrated, dynamic modelling and simulation framework that combines network and asset representations of infrastructure systems and models the optimal response to disruptions using a rolling planning horizon. The framework considers dependencies pertaining to failure propagation, system-of-systems architecture and resources required for operating and repairing assets. Stochastic asset failure is captured by a scenario tree generation algorithm whereas the redistribution of network flows and the optimal deployment of repair resources are modelled using a minimum cost flow approach. A case study on London's metro and electric power networks shows how the proposed methodology can be used to assess the resilience of city-scale infrastructure systems to a local flooding incident and estimate the value of the resilience loss triangle for different levels of hazard exposure and repair capabilities.},

	abstract = {The global container shipping network is vital to international trade. Current techniques for its vulnerability assessment are constrained due to the lack of historical disruption data and computational limitations due to typical network sizes. We address these modelling challenges by developing a new framework, composed by a game-theoretic attacker-defender model and a cost-based container assignment model that can identify systemic vulnerabilities in the network. Given its focus on logic and structure, the proposed framework has minimal input data requirements and does not rely on the presence of extensive historical disruption data. Numerical implementations are carried in a global-scale liner network where disruptions occur in Europe’s main container ports. Model outputs are used to establish performance baselines for the network and illus-trate the differences in regional vulnerability levels and port criticality rankings with different disruption magnitudes and flow diversion strategies. Sensitivity analysis of these outputs identifies network compo-nents that are more susceptible to lower levels of disruption which are more common in practice and to assess the effectiveness of component-level interventions seeking to increase the resilience of the system.},

	abstract = {The construction sector is currently undergoing a shift from stick-built construction to modular building systems that take advantage of modern prefabrication techniques. Long established in-situ construction practices are thus being replaced by processes imported from the manufacturing sector, where component fabrication takes place within a factory environment. As a result of this transformation, current construction supply chains, which have focused on the delivery of raw materials to sites, are no longer apt and need to make way to new, strengthened, and time-critical logistics systems. The aim of this study is to establish a mathematical model for the optimisation of logistics processes in modular construction covering three tiers of operation: manufacturing, storage and assembly. Previous studies have indicated that construction site delays constitute the largest cause of schedule deviations. Using the model outlined in this paper we seek to determine how factory manufacturing and inventory management should react to variations in the demand on construction sites. A two-stage stochastic programming model is developed to capture all possible demand variations on site. The model is evaluated using a case study from the residential construction sector. The application shows that the model is effective and can serve as decision support to optimise modular construction logistics.},

	abstract = {Understanding how container routing stands to be impacted by different scenarios of liner shipping network perturbations such as natural disasters or new major infrastructure developments is of key importance for decision-making in the liner shipping industry. The variety of actors and processes within modern supply chains and the complexity of their relationships have previously led to the development of simulation-based models, whose application has been largely compromised by their dependency on extensive and often confidential sets of data. This study proposes the application of optimisation techniques less dependent on complex data sets in order to develop a quantitative framework to assess the impacts of disruptive events on liner shipping networks. We provide a categorization of liner network perturbations, differentiating between systemic and external and formulate a container assignment model that minimises routing costs extending previous implementations to allow feasible solutions when routing capacity is reduced below transport demand. We develop a base case network for the Southeast Asia to Europe liner shipping trade and review of accidents related to port disruptions for two scenarios of seismic and political conflict hazards. Numerical results identify alternative routing paths and costs in the aftermath of port disruptions scenarios and suggest higher vulnerability of intra-regional connectivity.},

The first layer (cyber layer) represents a conceptual communication network where travel information is shared among drivers. The second layer (physical layer) captures the day-to-day evolution of a traffic network. Instead of having perfect information, the drivers are assumed to form groups, among which travel information is shared and utilized for routing decisions. The formation of groups occurs in the cyber layer according to the notion of percolation, which describes the formation of connected clusters in a random graph. The notion of percolation captures the disaggregated and distributed nature of travel information sharing. We present numerical studies on the convergence of the traffic network with a range of percolation rates. The findings suggest a positive correlation between the percolation rate and the speed of convergence, which is validated through statistical analysis.},

The traditional LNG trade on long-term contracts (LTCs) is considered and it is explained how vital these contracts are in distributing the volume and price risks in the industry, furthermore, in securing finance for the LNG projects. The essence of gas market liberalization and its effect on LTCs is considered and it is shown that in liberalized gas markets, risk has migrated to upstream. In the light of this risk redistribution, the suppliers’ intent in moving toward vertical integration of the industry is discussed. Later, various types of LNG spot sale in arbitrage, and for uncommitted product to LTCs, are considered and the biggest spot sale markets are identified. Finally, pricing of LNG for different markets in both LTCs and spot sales is discussed and it is forecast that due to the surge of supply, rather than any change in oil prices, LNG prices are anticipated to decrease globally at least for the next 5 years.},

The model is designed as a three-stage complete information game: in the first stage, the firms simultaneously invest in their fleet; in the second stage, they individually design their services and solve the route assignment problem with respect to the transport demand they expect to serve, given the fleet determined in the first stage; in the final stage, the firms compete in terms of freight rates on each origin–destination movement.

Urban design is moving toward space sharing as a means of increasing the community texture of street surroundings. Its unique features aim to balance priorities and allow cars and pedestrians to coexist harmoniously without the need to dictate behavior. There is, however, a need for a simulation tool to model future shared space schemes and to help judge whether they might represent suitable alternatives to traditional street layouts. This paper builds on the authors’ previously published work in which a shared space microscopic mixed traffic model based on the social force model (SFM) was presented, calibrated, and evaluated with data from the shared space link typology of New Road in Brighton, United Kingdom. Here, the goal is to explore the transferability of the authors’ model to a similar shared space typology and investigate the effect of flow and ratio of traffic modes. Data recorded from the shared space scheme of Exhibition Road, London, were collected and analyzed. The flow and speed of cars and segregation between pedestrians and cars are greater on Exhibition Road than on New Road. The rule-based SFM for shared space modeling is calibrated and validated with the real data. On the basis of the results, it can be concluded that shared space schemes are context dependent and that factors such as the infrastructural design of the environment and the flow and speed of pedestrians and vehicles affect the willingness to share space.},

	abstract = {As of January 2015, the new maximum limit of fuel sulfur content for ships sailing within emission control areas has been reduced to 0.1%. A critical decision for ship owners in advance of the new limits was the selection of an abatement method that complies with the regulations. Two main options exist: investing in scrubber systems that remove sulfur dioxide emissions from the exhaust and switching to low-sulfur fuel when sailing in regulated waters. The first option would involve significant capital costs, while the latter would lead to operating cost increases because of the higher price of the fuel used. This paper presents a literature review of emissions abatement options and relevant research in the field. A cost–benefit methodology to assess emission reduction investments from ship owners is also presented. A study examined the effects of recent drops in bunker fuel price to the payback period of a potential scrubber investment. The results show that lower prices would significantly delay the payback period of such investments, up to two times in some cases. The case studies present the emissions generation through each option for representative short sea shipping routes. The repercussions of low-sulfur policies on large emission reduction investments including cold ironing are examined, along with implications of slow steaming for their respective payback periods. Recommendations are made for research in anticipation of future regulations and technological improvements.},

	abstract = {Maritime shipping is regarded as the most efficient mode of transport; however, its contribution to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions and the health issues related to shipping activity near residential centers cannot be neglected. In recent years, the efforts of regulators, ship operators, and port authorities have led to actions for ship emissions reduction to improve shipping's environmental performance. This work builds on an activity-based methodology that allows the estimation of emissions and examines environmental effects of slow steaming, fuel regulations, near-port speed-reduction schemes, and cold ironing. Pollutant emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and black carbon are modeled. A linear programming model minimizes fuel consumption through speed differentiation on a shipping line's routes based on fuel costs and binding regulations in each segment of the journey. Although the examined emissions-reduction actions may have a positive regional environmental effect by cutting emissions, it is possible that additional emissions are generated elsewhere because of increased sailing speeds beyond regulated areas. Trade-offs between pollutants are observed for reduction actions that may have a positive effect on some emission species but at the same time result in additional particulate matter and black carbon emissions. The presented framework allows key actors to conduct comprehensive studies and design improved emissions reduction actions with fewer negative impacts in other areas.},

Carbon dioxide (CO2); sulphur dioxide (SO2); nitrogen oxides (NOx); and black carbon (BC) emissions from near-port containership activities are estimated. Two emissions reduction policies are considered for typical container terminals. Participation of all calling vessels with a speed reduction scheme can lead to reductions of 8–20 per cent, 9–40 per cent and 9–17 per cent for CO2, SO2 and NOx, respectively. However, speed reduction policies may increase BC emissions by up to 10 per cent. Provision of Alternative Marine Power (AMP) for all berthing vessels can reduce in-port emissions by 48–70 per cent, 3–60 per cent, 40–60 per cent and 57–70 per cent for CO2, SO2, NOx and BC, respectively. The analysis shows that emissions depend on visiting fleet, berthing durations, baseline operating pattern of calling ships, sulphur reduction policies in force and the emissions intensity of electricity supply. The potential of emissions reduction policies varies considerably across ports making imperative the evaluation and prioritization of such policies based on the unique characteristics of each port and each vessel.},

Empty and full stations in such systems are equally undesirable and disruptive for the operation of the network, since the former turn away potential users while the latter could not be used to terminate bicycle journeys. Repositioning practices have been used in the past to address this situation with partial success. This paper introduces a new planning approach for such activities, addressing both routing and assignment aspects of bicycle repositioning using a fleet of carrier vehicles. A case study on bicycle usage patterns from a large bicycle-sharing scheme is carried out; examples are also provided that demonstrate the behaviour of the algorithm. Implementation concerns and means to improve computational performance are also discussed.},

The objective is to assign containers to routes to minimise container handling costs, container rental and inventory costs. The constraints in the model are extended to include route as well as port capacities. It is shown that the problem remains a linear program. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the properties of the model. The paper concludes by considering the many applications of the proposed maritime container assignment model.}

In this model, containers are carried by shipping lines operating strings (or port rotations) with given service frequencies. An origin–destination matrix of full containers is assigned to these strings to minimize sailing time plus container dwell time at the origin port and any intermediate transhipment ports. This necessitated two significant model extensions. The first involves the repositioning of empty containers so that a net outflow of full containers from any port is balanced by a net inflow of empty containers, and vice versa. As with full containers, empty containers are repositioned to minimize the sum of sailing and dwell time, with a facility to discount the dwell time of empty containers in recognition of the absence of inventory. The second involves the inclusion of an upper limit to the maximum number of container moves per unit time at any port. The dual variable for this constraint provides a shadow price, or surcharge, for loading or unloading a container at a congested port. Insight into the interpretation of the dual variables is given by proposition and proof. Model behaviour is illustrated by a simple numerical example. The paper concludes by considering the next steps toward realising a container assignment model that can, amongst other things, support the assessment of supply chain vulnerability to maritime disruptions."

This paper presents a novel endogenous stochastic vehicle routing problem that coordinates UAV deployments and relief vehicle dispatches to minimise overall mission cost. The algorithm considers uncertain damage levels in a transport network, with UAVs revealing actual damage levels by performing rapid network assessment. Ground vehicles are simultaneously routed based on the information gathered by the UAVs. A greedy extact solution approach and an adapted Genetic Algorithm are used to solve a case study based on the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Both approaches provide significant improvements in vehicle travel time over a deterministic approach reported, and are used to quantify the benefits of UAV-assisted response.},

At any time, a global race is underway among cities and countries to become hosts to the tallest skyscraper, the longest bridge, or the largest airport. Record-breaking dimensions are the key feature of how civil engineering projects are usually covered in mainstream media and the biggest attraction for new entrants to the profession. In contemporary cities, however, civil engineers encounter a new family of engineering challenges that are of a different nature to the ones associated with the engagement with a single construction project. As urban agglomerations have reached unprecedented sizes, they have also reached unprecedented levels of complexity. This has sparked a revolution within the civil engineering profession, seeking to find new roles for civil engineers in addressing urban complexity challenges. This chapter initially provides a historical overview of the evolution of civil engineering that has been taking place alongside the constantly evolving nature of urbanization (Section 2). Section 3 describes the role that infrastructure plays in shaping how civil engineering perceives the urban. Finally, key issues that currently affect engineering projects are outlined, as well as the transformations that have been occurring in the civil engineering profession in order to better engage with projects within urban settings (Sections 4 and 5).},

Reduced fuel consumption leads to lower levels of greenhouse gases and pollutant emissions. Port authorities have considered offering incentives to ship operators that significantly reduce sailing speed in the port proximity, as a means to improve local air quality. The chapter conducts a literature review on emissions modelling methodologies for maritime transport and develops a framework that allows the estimation of pollutant emissions under different sailing scenarios. The chapter presents existing regulations and port initiatives that aim to reduce maritime emissions. The merits of localised slow steaming near the calling port for various case studies including different ship size, trip distance, sailing speed and fuel policies in place are examined. An activity based methodology is used to estimate fuel consumption and emissions savings during lower sailing speed operation for machinery on-board.  Fuel price and the value of time lost govern the extent to which slow steaming and local speed reductions can be effective. The economic and environmental trade-offs occurring at different sailing speeds are discussed from the perspective of both the ship operator and the port authority considering the implications of regulatory policies such as the expansion of Emission Control Areas (ECA). The chapter concludes with a set of guidelines to port authorities on designing attractive speed reduction programmes, and recommendations to shipping companies on improving fuel efficiency across their schedule when such programmes are available.},

Mixed traffic streams with different penetrations of eco-driving CAVs passing through a DWPT system-equipped signalized intersection are simulated using microscopic traffic simulation software VISSIM. Energy stored, which is defined as the result of energy transferred to the vehicle battery by DWPT system subtracting energy consumed by the vehicle battery whilst travelling the same distance, is used to evaluate the total impact of eco-driving behavior on energy consumption and charging capacity. The simulation results show that at full CAV penetration rate, there are 62% reduction of average energy consumption of all types of vehicles and 10% increase of average energy stored per battery electric vehicle compared to full HVs case. This indicates that the eco-driving driving behavior has positive impact on the energy stored powered by the DWPT system designed in this paper.},

 	abstract = 	{This paper presents a novel methodological framework to the definition of vulnerability indices in disaster risk management at container terminals, based on a top-down approach. This proposal is aimed at answering the need for improved consistency in information flows between implementors of risk management processes (e.g., terminal operators, port authorities, port risk committees) and risk analysts.  It also answers to the risk assessment and risk management push from the latest risk management ISO 31000:2018 guidance to work toward a more integrated approach with upper level strategies. In order to better correlate the risk indices provided by risk analysts to operational and risk management objectives of risk-bearers, a method relying on a dynamic value-flow stakeholder analysis is carried out for the different phases of the risk management cycle. A methodology is presented in this paper to successively build the stakeholder model, characterise the performance targets and needs of each and hence the value flows that link them together. Once these are qualitatively assessed, a quantitative assessment of the value contribution factors of each stakeholder interdependency within the network is proposed, based on the model of stakeholders’ satisfaction following a service-based operational approach.  Once those key stakeholders’ interdependencies are quantified and the critical stakeholders and links within the networks identified for the benefits of the container terminal operator, corresponding tangible vulnerability indices are defined. A dual approach to vulnerability indices definition is proposed. It consists in an internal operation vulnerability index and external contextual vulnerability indices that account for the environmental vulnerability contribution factors. The identification of the key internal operational vulnerability indices is based on fault tree analyses, whilst the contextual indices utilise the stakeholder model and existing macro socio-economic indices. Such vulnerability indices can then be utilised in natural disaster risk assessment frameworks consistently with key risk management decision making processes and corporate targets. },

	abstract	=	{In previous work, the authors pioneered the use of spanning trees to study the optimal structure of public transport networks. Spanning trees have the minimum number of links (one less than the number of nodes) and connect all nodes without loops. The spanning tree that minimises passenger-kilometers indicates where the public transport hubs should be located and which stations should be connected directly to each other. This paper applies the same technique to the world container shipping network to reveal the natural hubs and trade routes. However, finding the spanning tree with least TEU-kilometers poses two computational challenges. The first relates to the availability of demand data. We use a gravity model to estimate TEU flows between ports based on port throughput data and the nautical sailing distances between ports. The second relates to the size of the network. Cayley’s formula reveals that for n nodes there are nn-2 distinct spanning trees, rendering finding an exact solution impractical as the number of ports in the database (n) exceeds 460. Two heuristics developed for the earlier public transport work were applied here. The results reveal how the number of hubs in the maritime network depends on the elasticity of demand with respect to sailing distance. Where the elasticity of demand is low, there are few large hubs, while when the elasticity of demand is high, there are many smaller hubs. For elasticities of demand between the extremes, the larger hubs appear in logical locations, like Singapore and Rotterdam.},

However, the employment of this new construction method has not only altered the definition of construction supply chain, but also poses new challenges to the logistics system which has conventionally focused on raw material transportation. This challenge is exacerbated in the transport and inventory aspects when the project is executed in the urban settings, owing to the frequent traffic congestion, crowded environment, as well as the bulkiness and delicacy of finished modules. This study develops a multi-stage stochastic programming model for identifying the optimal supply chain configuration for the modular construction method. Site demand is considered to be stochastic, forcing the project managers to make several operational decisions at multiple time points during project execution. The developed model can provide the best production, transportation and inventory plans, as well as the most favourable initial inventory preparation schemes. Furthermore, we have proven that the implementation of multi-stage stochastic programming model can yield more economical and risk-averse solutions than the two-stage stochastic programming approach.},

Apart from regulatory hurdles, low payload and range, a fundamental limitation for their large-scale implementation relate to airspace management. UAV operations are expected to occur in shared airspace with static and dynamic obstacles, including low altitude manned flight and areas of prohibitive weather. Given the large UAV fleet sizes envisioned, it becomes imperative to create airspace management heuristics that provide optimal and non-conflicting flight paths under short runtime. To this effect, we develop a dynamic airspace sectorisation algorithm that discretises the airspace into sectors. The optimal arrangement and size of airspace sectors are determined by the fleet position and direction, and change during the operation time window. A trajectory heuristic is integrated into the sectorisation algorithm that determines non-conflicting optimal paths for every vehicle, conforming to the Performance Based Navigation requirements and considering payload and range variations. The proposed methodology is applied to a UAV relief delivery operation in the aftermath of the Chi-Chi earthquake, in Taiwan. The model is compared with a single sector case and a static airspace case, where sectors are pre-determined based on the warehouse locations. Results show a substantial acceleration in runtime with minimal increase in flight-time and mission time.},

Indeed, a recent study by has presented evidence that such shifts have already occurred and can be directly linked to increased congestion in major cities. Many studies in taxi pricing have adopted an economic theory perspective, using aggregate demand and supply models to represent the dynamics of urban taxi operations. However, the relationship between dynamic TNC pricing strategies and public transport provision remains unexplored to this date. To address this issue, we propose a novel, game-theoretic, dynamic pricing model that accounts for multiple TNCs operating alongside public transport services. This is applied to a city-wide service scenario, and compared to an alternative static pricing model that serves as a baseline. Finally, we perform a comparative analysis of expected utilities for travellers and operators, while monitoring mode share fluctuations across a range of competitive scenarios and market structures.},

Given the desire to reduce operating costs and the emergence of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), the introduction of TNC-owned AV fleets could convert such services into one-sided markets, where operators have full control of service supply. In this paper we investigate the impact of utility-based dynamic pricing for Autonomous TNCs (ATNCs) in one-sided markets. We test the method using an Agent-Based Model (ABM) of Greater London in conditions of monopoly and competition, focusing on a statically priced ATNC service that offers a mix of private and shared ride services. Public transport is considered as an alternative mode of transportation in both scenarios. Results indicate that in monopoly, dynamic pricing provides higher revenues than static pricing at non-peak hours when average waiting times are low. On the contrary, in competition, dynamic pricing is superior at peak hours where increased waiting times are observed, thus increasing the value of low waiting time rides. Overall, in both market structures, it is found that shared trips are more popular in dynamic pricing compared to static pricing.},

	abstract 	= 	{Unmanned Aerial Vehicles have the potential to provide an economical solution to the challenges of post-disaster land-based relief operations. Beyond regulatory concerns, technical and particularly airspace integration limitations inhibit their deployment in practice. To address these issues and ensure uninterrupted optimal operations, we present a novel approach consisting of an integrated trajectory-location-routing algorithm that seeks to determine the optimal location of supporting infrastructure in the distribution supply chain. Unique to this approach is the consideration of dynamic obstacle avoidance and variable battery consumption relationships. An approximate algorithm based on a bi-level Large Neighbourhood Search is used to obtain close to optimal solutions under reasonable runtime. Results show that fleets of small UAVs could quickly distribute relief supplies to affected population groups with minimal reliance on ground infrastructure.},

While Heavy Goods Vehicles and buses contribute about 4% of the total Greenhouse Gas emissions in the UK, these emissions only decrease by 10% between 1990 and 2015. Urban areas are particularly susceptible to emissions and can have a significant impact upon the health of residents. For Heavy Goods Vehicles, braking losses are one of the most significant losses. A Kinetic Energy Recovery System can help reduce these emissions, and increase fuel efficiency by up to 30 %. This paper describes an InnovateUK funded project aimed at evaluating the technical and economic feasibility of a retrofitted Kinetic Energy Recovery System on Heavy Goods Vehicles through an operational trial, controlled emissions and fuel tests, and numerical modelling. A series of preliminary results using a numerical vehicle model is compared with operational data, along with simulations comparing the fuel efficiency of a Heavy Goods Vehicle with and without the KERS.},

Empirical studies have documented such interdependency effects for various catastrophic events, including the 2001 terror attack in New York City (Lee II, Mitchell, and Wallace 2007), the 2003 electrical blackout in Italy (Buldyrev et al. 2010), various hurricanes in Florida (McDaniels et al. 2007), the 2008 winter storms in China (Rong, Han, and Liu 2010), and the 2010 earthquake in Chile (Dueñas-Osorio and Kwasinski 2012). For the development of strategies to enhance the resilience of urban transport systems, quantitative models are needed that take into account interdependencies and can evaluate the performance of different system configurations in a what-if analysis for various hazard scenarios. Previous studies on this problem have extended classical network flow theory to include interdependency effects (e.g. Lee II, Mitchell, and Wallace 2007; Holden et al. 2013; Fotouhi, Moryadee, and Miller-Hooks 2017). This paper aims to contribute to the further development of this methodology with a dynamic network flow model that captures various types of dependency relations and different degrees of anticipation. The proposed method comprises a stochastic model that generates scenarios for the operability of infrastructure network assets, and a minimum cost flow assignment model for the simulation of dynamic flows in coupled networks. Interdependency effects are taken into account both at the asset operability level and at the network flow level. The flow assignment model can simulate different degrees of anticipation, allowing the model to capture important aspects related to operational decision-making, for example, information sharing between network operators and the use of predictive models to estimate recovery times. A case study on London’s metro system demonstrates how the proposed method can be used to quantify the effects of interdependency and anticipation in a flooding scenario.},

However, currently available simulation models are not able to provide a sufficiently detailed understanding of how these interactions affect the overall resilience of urban infrastructure after disruptive events. This paper presents a novel assessment method that considers interdependencies both at the level of individual infrastructure assets and at the network level. The method uses a stochastic process to simulate the loss and recovery of asset operability taking into account the propagation of failure probabilities and recovery delays due to dependencies on other systems. For the network level, a minimum cost flow assignment model is developed that enables the simulation of coupled flows in interdependent networks. Infrastructure resilience is evaluated as the overall ability of the systems to meet certain demand levels in disruptive event scenarios. A case study analysing the resilience of London’s mass transit and electricity networks against flooding demonstrates the key features of the model and how it could be used to devise more effective strategies for the improvement of urban infrastructure resilience.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the findings of a study developing a methodological framework for the quantification of natural disasters’ disruptive impacts on the global container shipping network and the assessment of potential rerouting options. The natural disasters considered are earthquakes, storms and tsunamis. The global shipping network is modelled as a top-level network of nodes (terminals, and key logistical and transportation nodes) and links (shipping routes, at sea and inland). Each node’s probability of performance loss is assessed based on a combination of fault tree, hazard scenario tree and network flow analyses considering interdependences between physical systems (including infrastructure services networks) and operational systems. The proposed approach relies on an attacker-defender model combined to a cost-based container assignment model to assess routing and disruption costs and allow the identification of optimum alternative routing paths after a disruption. The paper then showcases the application of this methodology to the case study of the shipping routes associated to the KIX Australia-Asia Shipping line. The findings of this study are presented, additionally to disruption costs, as maps showing the probable loss of terminals’ performance in terms of container throughput, and in terms of loss of transmissivity capacity for hinterland links. Optimal alternative hinterland links and container terminal rerouting options are also proposed.}

At the same time, it has been demonstrated that in certain cases, such enhancements might prove detrimental to overall performance, or would increase vulnerability to disruptions due to systemic complexity. Asia-to-Europe liner services represent one of the key segments of the international container shipping market. The recently established One-Belt-One-Road (OBOR) policy aims to further enhance the performance of this corridor, with a range of initiatives that notably include a set of overland direct rail service between China and Europe. These can halve the transit times ordinarily required by traditional liner services, and as such have the potential reduce overall shipping costs for certain product classes of despite the increased cost of rail service. With the increasing attention attracted by these initiatives, it is crucial to understand their potential impact to the global container transport network. Furthermore, the effects of long-standing concerns, such as transhipment, trade imbalance, modal integration and resilience should be examined in new light. We address these challenges with a quantitative framework capable of identifying most vulnerable components in large networks with limited or no historical disruption data. We propose a game-theoretic attacker-defender model (ADM) consisting of a two-player, zero-sum game between a global ocean carrier (defender) that aims at minimising container routing costs and malevolent agent (attacker) that aims at maximising disruption costs. A numerical case study for the Asia-to-Europe trade is constructed to assess the impact of the OBOR freight corridor on network resilience. Results identify the most vulnerable network components and interventions that would increase system resilience such as investment on alternative transhipment hubs.},

  abstract = {In the past ten years, the popularity of car sharing schemes has been growing rapidly. Depending on service policies, a customer might be required to return the vehicle to the same location or a different one. The latter type of service is termed as one-way car sharing since the client is not required to make a return trip to leave the vehicle. It is expected that the car sharing companies will start offering autonomous vehicles in their fleet in the future, in line with the growth of investment in autonomous cars in the automotive industry. Fleet management of autonomous vehicles is, therefore, an area which could be explored to devise and offer solutions to companies regarding autonomous vehicle applications. This paper explores the implementation of an approach with a mixed-integer programming (MIP) algorithm which is inspired by one-way car sharing schemes, to offer assistance on strategic decisions such as fleet size, depot location, and number, as well as depot capacity for shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) systems within cities. The proposed model uses stochastic demand based on expected origin and destination (OD) matrices for a modified version of the Sioux Falls network, incorporates relocations to serve demand and is subject to charging and maintenance constraints. The results show that the proposed model could potentially be used in larger networks, with expected demand of trips to be used as a relocation strategy.},

However, traffic congestions due to the surge in demand and inefficient planning often limits the effectiveness of an evacuation. In this study, it is suggested that scheduling the departure time and assisting the destination and path choice of evacuees could optimise the evacuation process. A real-time decision support and pre-planning model is proposed, and a system-optimal dynamic traffic assignment problem is formulated. A simulation-based metaheuristic is used, consisting of an upper-level that is a genetic algorithm engine which optimises the solution, and a lower-level that is a traffic simulator which evaluates the goodness of the solutions generated by the upper-level. The traffic simulator is a macroscopic dynamic traffic assignment model that captures queuing and congestion. The model is tested on the Sioux-Falls network and an expanded, more realistic version of that network, known as Enriched Sioux-Falls network. The effects of varying the number of paths evacuees are allowed to use and the frequency of decisions made is observed. The proposed model showed that scheduling departure time is an effective method to improve evacuation efficiency when compared to a worst case benchmark scenario.},

The method uses a Markov process to generate operability scenarios and a multistage stochastic linear program to assign dynamic flows and optimise network capacities. The model takes into account different mechanisms of cascading failure, namely failure propagation, delay of recovery and unavailability of production inputs. A numeric example demonstrates how the method can be used to assess and optimises the resilience of a global supply chain against multiple hazards and infrastructure failure.},

Furthermore, storage facility between factory and construction site becomes indispensable because these components are large in size, yielding a three-tier supply chain that is absent in the traditional construction. The objective of this research is to determine the most appropriate production plan and the optimal outsourcing quantities for multi-prefabricated components under this context. A workflow which includes a two-stage stochastic programming model and a mixed integer linear programming model is established for solving the above issues. Also, the most favourable schemes for distributing components and the variation of inventory are also disclosed.

In these studies, the reasons for schedule deviation were identified through the point of view of the stakeholders in construction projects. In addition, delay factors are typically considered individually and are presented at the same level. In reality, owing to the complex structure of construction projects and long execution time, non-conformance in schedules occurs by a chain of events. The aim of this research is to investigate the factors causing schedule deviation in construction projects and understand the cause-effect relationships between the events leading to delays. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is an established tool to root cause problems. FTA looks deeply into the chain of events leading to a problem to identify its primary cause. FTA was applied to a modular construction project that experienced significant delays. The analysis identified multiple delay factors, and showed how they are linked from the primary causes to the ultimate event. A comparison was performed between FTA and the conventional deduction method from log books employed by construction companies.},

Changes to the structure of this network, such as increased reliance on hub-and-spoke configurations driven by the introduction of larger container vessels or reduction of buffer times to minimise operational costs stand to alter the ability of the network to withstand disruptions. Such impacts on transport network vulnerability are often paradoxical or not intended. Understanding the extent to which changes in the configurations of liner shipping networks impact transport network vulnerability is of vital importance for public and private decision-makers of the maritime industry responsible for ensuring accessibility to global liner shipping services. This study proposes a game theoretic approach to identify most vulnerable components in liner shipping networks exposed to disruptive events such as loss of functionality in ports due to natural disasters or potential terrorist attacks. We develop a two-player, non-cooperative, zero-sum game between a malevolent agent who tries to maximise disruption costs and a network router who tries to minimise routing costs. A numerical example is presented where, at mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, the most vulnerable nodes and links are identified and the minimum cost routes for given origin destination pairs are found. Results are also used to identify sets of interventions that would increase the robustness of the network.},

The theory of complex networks has been instrumental in modelling such interdependent infrastructure systems and identifying conditions for catastrophic cascades of failures. Many of the coupling phenomena, however, cannot be captured with models that consider only connectivity. This paper presents a method that models the transmission of failure across system boundaries using measures that represent the capacity and load at the level of individual network components. This enables a more comprehensive analysis, for example by taking into account the dynamic effects of demand fluctuations, redistribution of network loads and recovery mechanisms.},

This paper uses queuing theory, Petri Networks (PNs) and discrete event simulation to compare the impact on the productivity of yard-side operations in a container terminal of utilising different numbers of Automated Straddle Carriers (AStCs). PNs and discrete event modelling techniques divide complex continuous systems into subsystems and analyse the system as a series of sequential operations being performed on certain entities. Discrete event simulation is used for the utilisation of AStCs with gang and pooling deployment strategies. Venice’s new off-shore terminal is used for modelling the complex processes of a container terminal in order to determine the optimal number of AStCs. The equipment sizing results gained from the developed PN and discrete event simulation are closely matching with the optimal solution determined from various models of queuing theory. Given the different effort required for the three methods, it can be concluded that PN represents a fair trade-off and is the methodology of choice for equipment sizing problems, compared to analytic queuing theory and complex discrete event simulations.},

	abstract 	= 	{Over the last decades, slow steaming strategies have been adopted by most shipping lines with the aim of reducing fuel costs. At the same time, these have resulted in significant environmental benefits from emissions reductions, which have contributed to a relative reduction to of the footprint of maritime transport, currently accounting for about 3% of the total world carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Such initiatives need to be expanded as the maritime transport demand steadily grows and its impacts increase. The maritime transport is also responsible for sulfur, nitrogen and Particulate Matter emissions, which can pose significant threats to public health and resulted in calls from local communities for action. Near port emissions from ships can be classified into three types; those that originate from near-port cruising, manoeuvring and berth emissions. Port authorities tend to develop policies and apply technological solutions to address these types. Slow steaming has been recognised as one of the most promising approaches to reduce cruising emissions. This paper examines the effects of such policies locally and globally, and seeks to answer how to best deploy a vessel speed reduction program for a port authority in order to achieve the highest possible local benefits without compromising on a global level. The economic consequences of adopting such policies are discussed, along with the effects of sulfur emission control areas. The local versus global trade-offs between different pollutants are discussed and the proposed methodology allows the calculation of such trade-offs.},

	abstract 	= 	{Transport operations are significant contributors to pollutant emissions across the globe. Maritime transport is responsible for approximately 3% of the global carbon emissions, while emissions around ports from vessel traffic and stationary ships also affect the local environment. This paper presents a framework for examining these impacts considering the environmental footprint of 1) ships approaching/departing and 2) berthing at ports, where their emissions impact directly on local air quality and on the exposure of the local population. Speed reduction of ships in transit and cold ironing for berthing ships are examined as possible mitigation techniques to illustrate their potential to reduce emissions for a range of different port and vessel types. Their scope is assessed per call per ship for the reduction of emissions for carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide (NOx). Both methods are found to be effective, although the results are strongly dependent on the vessel specification and port operating characteristics. For speed reduction, key factors include the fuel used, the size of the vessel, its operating speed and the speed reduction policy adopted. For cold ironing, the port turnaround time, the source of shore electrical power and policies regarding fuel sulphur content are significant. While the two techniques can be applied independently, one of the two may be preferable in a specific port or for specific vessels. Reductions of 55.1 tonnes of CO2, 267 kg of SO2 and 2046 kg of NOx are seen for the combination of speed reduction for a large ship and prolonged berth duration using a representative shore electrical supply. These results suggest that policies and practices available to shippers can deliver environmental benefits; however, a clear appraisal for costs and benefits of alternatives is essential to inform effective policy development.},

	abstract 	= 	{This paper transposes the classic frequency-based transit assignment method of Spiess and Florian to containers demonstrating its promise as the basis for a global maritime container assignment model. In this model, containers are carried by shipping lines operating strings (or port rotations) with given service frequencies. An origin-destination matrix of full containers is assigned to these strings to minimize sailing time plus container dwell time at the origin port and any intermediate transhipment ports. This necessitated two significant model extensions. The first involves the repositioning of empty containers so that a net outflow of full containers from any port is balanced by a net inflow of empty containers, and vice versa. As with full containers, empty containers are repositioned to minimize the sum of sailing and dwell time, with a facility to discount the dwell time of empty containers in recognition of the absence of inventory. The second involves the inclusion of an upper limit to the maximum number of container moves per unit time at any port. The dual variable for this constraint provides a shadow price, or surcharge, for loading or unloading a container at a congested port. Insight into the interpretation of the dual variables is given by proposition and proof. Model behavior is illustrated by a numerical example applied to the Asia-Europe schedules of a major liner company. The paper concludes by considering the next steps toward realizing a container assignment model that can, amongst other things, support the assessment of supply chain vulnerability to maritime disruptions.},

  	abstract 	= 	{Several bike sharing schemes have been deployed around the world over the last decade, with one launching in London over the summer of 2010. A common operational problem with such schemes is the availability of adequate bikes (enough to satisfy demand from users wishing to depart from an area) as well as empty spaces (in order to accommodate demand from users arriving to an area and wishing to part with their bikes). Arrival and departure patterns are found to vary significantly during the course of each day and the week. To meet both types of demand, bike scheme operators commonly deploy teams that work around the clock repositioning bikes among bike stations throughout the city. Using the London bike sharing scheme as a case study and utilising bike availability data collected from the Transport for London website, we seek to establish bike travel patterns. We then proceed with the development of a bike repositioning algorithm that meets both types of demand while seeking to minimise operational cost. The latter is determined by the amount of teams operating at any time, distance travelled and the amount of bikes that need to be moved across the city as part of this process.},

Their use in the planning stages of a new terminal can assist in streamlining the operation of the port, help identify and resolve potential performance bottlenecks even before the construction of the port has been completed. Due to the complexity and unique nature of the every port, these are commonly purpose-build for specific deployments, and given the amount of detail offered, they are costly to develop and maintain.

	abstract 	= 	{Originating from a freight transportation idea using trailers and attributed to Malcolm McLean, container shipment is probably the biggest development in the field of logistics since the invention of the locomotive two centuries ago. Over the last 50 years, containerization has grown to account nowadays for roughly 70% of total deep sea trade (by value), with annual shipping rates of 143 million TEU (Twenty-foot equivalent units) worldwide in 2008 and an equivalent tonnage of 1.24 billion tons (UNCTAD 2008). Equipment found in container terminals has evolved over the years to enable port operators to keep pace these growing container flows. Space constraints, especially in European ports where land comes at a premium, led to denser stacking and taller, more capable cranes. Operators were quick to adopt latest advances in information technology, which have transformed the way ports operate.  Much like their desktop computer counterparts, Terminal Operating Systems (TOS) control port operations, managing the flow of information between different families of equipment and coordinating their operation. In conjunction with advances in logistics and optimisation theory, they have simplified terminal management, boosted terminal efficiency and contributed to the decrease of container dwell times. Conceived as a possibility in the early 1980s and intensively developed ever since, container terminal automation involves remotely operated container handling equipment capable of operating without direct human intervention. After a period of further research and development, more operators gained confidence in the new technology and eventually ventured into their own implementations.

  abstract 		= 	{Over recent years, there has been an increasing interest in automated operations of container terminals throughout Western Europe, starting with ECT in Rotterdam and culminating with Altenwerder in Hamburg. The format for automated container terminal operations is centred on the use of Automated Guided Vehicles for horizontal container movements and Automated Stacking Cranes for vertical movements. To justify the large initial investment required to develop such ports it has to be guaranteed that they will offer a significant operational and performance advantage over alternative setups. With the sheer size and unpredictability of the operations taking place at any time, in order to achieve the needed performance levels movements in the terminal have to be optimally pre‐planned and coordinated, thus resulting to a highly complex optimisation problem. Optimisation methods used in recent automated container terminals operate by decomposing key aspects of the problem into different subproblems, a practice that is known to lead to sub‐optimal solutions in this context. We develop a new control algorithm that jointly optimises most of the problem aspects, based in robust optimisation methods and implement them in prototype terminal control software. Robust optimisation involves the definition of intervals for key parameters, like the start time and duration for individual container movements, and then looks for a solution that minimises maximum regret with respect to particular realisations of parameters. The overall control objective, namely the minimisation of ship loading times, provides the measure of regret. The optimisation takes future events into account through a rolling planning horizon, using intervals to allow for their uncertainty},

Not only are they vital in providing marine connections, but they are also a critical economic asset which help create connectivity for both passengers and merchandise. Often ferry ports are the gateway to a region, welcoming tourists and freight hauliers onto the country’s transport network. Like many transport infrastructure elements, congestion occurs, due to peaked demand, conflicts in operational requirements, variability in arrivals and unexpected events. Major bottlenecks at any port are the check in facilities to the ferries.A 3 dimensional simulation model of port operations and check in facilities for the present and the future operations has been created. The model can be used to evaluate the present and future processing times of vehicles through various components of ferry port operation. In addition to the testing of average of peaked demand conditions, the simulation model has been used to test the early or late running of ferries on port operations, the impact of incidents, technology failure and high security alerts. The adaptive model can use used to optimise ferry timetables, port layout and predict the most effective check in times for freight vehicles. The model has been used to investigate introducing intelligent check-in facilities in the port of Dover, United Kingdom. The port of Dover handles more than 1.8 million passengers and 400,000 cars during the peak tourist month of August. In addition, it caters to more than 1.5 million freight vehicles and has over 14,000 scheduled ferry departures annually. The paper will report on the model’s capability to represent current operations of the port and ferry handling facilities, and will present outcomes of a modelled move towards intelligent check-in facilities.},
